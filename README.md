# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:  
In this project we are analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance.This analysis assists the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. So we need to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then we have to make comparison to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.
## Results:  
* How is the district summary affected?
*How is the school summary affected?
*How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to *the other schools?
*How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
*Math and reading scores by grade
*Scores by school spending
*Scores by school size
*Scores by school type
## Summary:  
 Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
